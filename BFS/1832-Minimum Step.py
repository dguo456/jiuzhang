# 1832 Â· Minimum Step
"""
There is a 1 * n chess table, indexed with 0, 1, 2 .. n - 1, every grid is colored.
And there is a chess piece on position 0, please calculate the minimum step that 
you should move it to position n-1.

Here are 3 ways to move the piece, the piece can't be moved outside of the table:
1.  Move the piece from position ii to position i + 1.
2.  Move the piece from position ii to positino i - 1.
3.  If the colors on position i and position j are same, you can 
    move the piece directly from position i to position j.
"""

# Input:
# colors = [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 5]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 
# In the example. you should move the piece 3 times:
# 1. Move from position 0 to position 1.
# 2. Because of the same color in position 1 and position 4, move from position 1 to position 4,
# 3. Move from position 4 to position 5.
