# 387 Â· The Smallest Difference
"""
Given two array of integers(the first array is array A, the second array is array B), 
now we are going to find a element in array A which is A[i], and another element in array B which is B[j], 
so that the difference between A[i] and B[j] is as small as possible, return their smallest difference.

Input: A = [3, 6, 7, 4], B = [2, 8, 9, 3]
Output: 0
Explanation: A[0] - B[3] = 0
