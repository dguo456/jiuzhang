# 1165 Â· Subtree of Another Tree
"""
Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure 
and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all 
of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Given tree s:
     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
    /
   0
Given tree t:
   4

 1   2
Return false.
