# 383 Â· Container With Most Water
"""
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). 
Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Input: [1, 3, 2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Selecting a1, a2, capacity is 1 * 1 = 1
Selecting a1, a3, capacity is 1 * 2 = 2
Selecting a2, a3, capacity is 2 * 1 = 2
