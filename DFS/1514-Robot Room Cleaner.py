# 1514 Â· Robot Room Cleaner
"""
Given a robot cleaner in a room modeled as a grid. Each cell in the grid can be empty or blocked.
The robot cleaner with 4 given APIs can move forward, turn left or turn right. Each turn it made is 
90 degrees. When it tries to move into a blocked cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle and it 
stays on the current cell. Design an algorithm to clean the entire room using only the 4 given APIs.

Input:
room = [
  [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
  [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],
  [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
  [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
],
row = 1,
col = 3
Explanation:
All grids in the room are marked by either 0 or 1.
0 means the cell is blocked, while 1 means the cell is accessible.
The robot initially starts at the position of row=1, col=3.
From the top left corner, its position is one row below and three columns right.
